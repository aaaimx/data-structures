# Data Structures

A **data structure** organizes related data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently. 

Different kinds of data structures are suited to different kinds of applications, and some are highly specialized to specific tasks. For example, [graphs]() are used to represent connections on social websites (such as Twitter, Facebook), **trees** are used to represent hierarchical data, such as files and folders in a filesystem, [queues]() can be used to create task schedulers, compiler implementations usually use [hash tables]() to look up identifiers, [binary trees]() are used in searching algorithms, etc.

Usually, choosing the correct data structure is key to designing an efficient algorithm.

Some of the most common data structures are:
 - Array
 - Linked List
 - Stack, Queue
 - Graph, Tree
 - Hash Table

Some data structures can be used to create others, for example, linked lists can be used to create stacks and queues.

> Each data structure has a set of operations that can be performed on the data it stores. We select a data structure based on the operations required to implement an algorithm.
