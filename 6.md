# Binary Tree

Unlike linear data structures (Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues), Binary trees are **hierarchical**. 

They consist of interconnected nodes. The topmost node is called the root. For a given node, the nodes that are directly under are called its children. 

The tree is called binary because each node can have at most two children. 

The node directly above another node is called its parent. 

The tree which is a child of a node is called subtree. 

Elements with no children are called leaves. 

The maximum number of nodes from root to leaf is called the height.

## Types
There are various types of binary trees, each having characteristics suitable for its purpose.

### Full Binary Tree
A binary tree is considered full if every node has 0 or 2 children.

### Complete Binary Tree
A binary tree is considered complete if all levels are completely filled except possibly the last level and the last level has all nodes as far left as possible.

### Perfect Binary Tree
A binary tree is considered perfect if all internal nodes have two children and all leaves are at the same level.

## Advantages
- Trees reflect structural relationships in the data, and are used to represent hierarchies.
- Trees provide efficient insertion and searching.
- Trees are very flexible, allowing  subtrees to be moved around with minimum effort.

> One of the most common applications of the binary tree is the [Binary Search Tree (BST)](), which is used in many search applications.
