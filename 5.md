# Graph

**Graphs** are used to represent many real-life applications like networks, transportation paths of a city, and social networks such as Facebook where each person represents a single node. Graphs are useful in many applications of computer science as well.

A graph is a set of connected nodes where each node is called a **Vertex** and the connection between two of them is called an Edge. We define a Graph as a data structure that consists of finite vertices and edges.

There are two types of graphs, **undirected** (A) and **directed** (B):

## Undirected Graphs
Image A is an example of an **undirected graph**. Here, the edges do not have directions, meaning that if the vertex u is connected to v, then v is connected to u.
Undirected graphs usually are drawn with straight lines between the vertices (no arrows).

Example: On Facebook, if user A is a friend of user B, that automatically means that user B is a friend of user A.

## Directed Graphs
Image B is an example of a **directed graph**. Here, each edge has a defined direction, which is usually represented with arrows. Having u connected to v does not necessarily mean that v is connected to u.

Example: On Twitter, if user A follows user B, then user B does not necessarily follow user A back.
