# Stack 

A **stack** is a simple data structure that adds and removes elements in a particular order. 
Every time an element is added, it goes on the "top" of the stack. Only an element at the top of the stack can be removed, just like a stack of plates. This behavior is called LIFO (Last In, First Out).

**Terminology**
- Adding a new element onto the stack is called push.
- Removing an element from the stack is called pop.

**Applications**
- Stacks can be used to create undo-redo functionalities, parsing expressions (infix to postfix/prefix conversion), and much more.

> A stack can be implemented using an array or a linked list.
