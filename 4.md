# Queue

A **queue** is a simple data structure that allows elements to be inserted from one end, called the **rear** (also called tail), and deleted from the other end, called the **front** (also called head).
This behavior is called **FIFO** (First in First Out).

**Terminology**
- The process of adding new elements into the queue is called enqueue.
- The process of removal of an element from the queue is called dequeue.

**Applications**
- Queues are used whenever we need to manage objects in order starting with the first one in.
- Scenarios include printing documents on a printer, call center systems answering people on hold people, and so on.

> A queue can be implemented using an array or a linked list.
